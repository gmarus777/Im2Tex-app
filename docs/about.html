        <p>The inspiration for <span style="color: black;font-weight: bold">Im</span><span style="color: rgb(42, 150, 140);font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: rgb(221, 102, 154);font-weight: bold">Tex</span> project stems from my involvement in a project led by Dr. Jan Reimann at Penn State University. The primary objective of this project was to develop a platform utilizing Jupyter Notebooks for open-source content sharing, enabling the creation and deployment of accessible and interactive course content. The resulting infrastructure our team developed supports supports a diverse range of content delivery formats, such as e-books, interactive computational notebooks, and QTI quizzes for importing into Canvas. Additionally, it offers flexible and cost-effective cloud-hosting workflows, effectively addressing a common barrier to using Jupyter Notebooks in classrooms. Our team leveraged this platform to redesign the Math 110 Techniques of Calculus course at Penn State, successfully piloting it in Spring 2022. While working on this groundbreaking educational endeavor, I identified a significant gap in the available tools: there was no open-source OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software capable of processing images of full-page PDFs or the PDFs themselves, which contained both mathematical formulas and text, and converting them into LaTeX code. Recognizing the immense potential of such a solution, I embarked on a multi-stage project aimed at developing a comprehensive, open-source full-page-to-LaTeX OCR software. As it stands, we have successfully implemented OCR capabilities for mathematical formulas and are actively working to extend our software to handle full pages including handwritten notes.

            Our system utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone and Transformer decoder model and accurately recognize and interpret complex mathematical symbols, expressions, and equations within the images. The tool is highly versatile, user-friendly, and ensures precise conversion into LaTeX code, making it an essential solution for mathematicians, educators, and researchers alike.
